# The tofino2 has 20 stages, and the current sidecar.p4 needs all 20 of them.
# Specifying the number of stages isn't strictly necessary, but it allows us to
# track when we exceed the current ceiling. The underlying intention is to grow
# deliberately and thoughtfully, given the limited space on the ASIC.
#
# Note: this now seems silly since we have maxed out the number of stages, but
# we want to leave this check and note in place should we ever find a way to
# reduce our footprint below 20 stages.
TOFINO_STAGES=20
